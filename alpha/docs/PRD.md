**Product Name:** AutomoBee Vehicle Detection System

---

### Overview
AutomoBee is a real-time traffic monitoring system designed to analyze and classify vehicle movements through a city's public CCTV camera network. The system leverages computer vision and AI to detect, classify, catalogue, and record every vehicle observed on the network, providing comprehensive data logging and real-time analytics.

### Key Features

#### 1. Real-time Vehicle Detection and Classification
- **Vehicle Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8m for identifying vehicles such as cars, trucks, vans, motorcycles, and freight trucks in real-time.
- **Vehicle Classification:** Employs EfficientNetV2-S for classifying the make and model of detected vehicles.
- **Target Vehicle Identification:** Users can specify a target vehicle by make and model for focused detection.

#### 2. Data Logging and Recording
- **Persistent Data Storage:** Logs movements of every classified vehicle, including time, date, location, direction of travel, and the camera stream.
- **Video Frame Storage:** Saves a copy of the video frame used for classification, allowing for detailed post-event analysis.
- **Search and Retrieval:** Provides advanced filtering and search functionality based on various parameters such as location, make, model, and time.

#### 3. Real-time Statistics and Monitoring
- **Live Map Visualization:** Displays an interactive map showing the geographic locations of camera streams.
- **Real-time Data Updates:** Continuously updates vehicle detection metrics, recent detections, and classification statistics.

#### 4. System Architecture
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilizes Python for efficient asynchronous processing.
- **Modular Design:** Features a modular architecture with distinct components for detection, classification, and data management.

#### 5. Frontend and User Interface
- **Responsive UI:** Supports both desktop and mobile platforms with a modern, responsive layout.
- **Interactive Map:** Allows users to interact with camera streams plotted on the map. Clicking a marker opens a modal with live stream and real-time data.
- **Real-time Analytics Dashboard:** Displays key metrics, statistics, and recent detections with filtering options.

#### 6. System Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Health Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the health of the detection system.
- **Automatic Retry Mechanism:** Implements automatic retries for failed operations.
- **Alert System:** Notifies users of critical events.
- **Performance Logging:** Tracks system performance and logs for analysis.

### Key Components
- **Vehicle Detection Module:** Handles the detection of vehicles in video streams.
- **Classification Module:** Classifies the detected vehicles by make and model.
- **Web Dashboard:** Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and interaction.
- **Data Storage:** Manages persistent storage for detection data, video frames, and configurations.

### Performance Requirements
- **Detection Latency:** Real-time detection latency should be less than 200ms.
- **Concurrent Streams:** Supports multiple concurrent camera streams efficiently.
- **Automatic Recovery:** Handles periodic camera feed outages with automatic recovery.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Implements caching to optimize memory usage.
- **Scalability:** Scales the detection pipeline to handle increased data load.

### Constraints & Limitations
- **GPU Requirements:** Optimal performance requires GPU acceleration.
- **Network Bandwidth:** High bandwidth is necessary for video stream processing.
- **Storage Requirements:** Significant storage needed for detection data and video frames.
- **Processing Capacity:** System must operate within defined capacity limits.
